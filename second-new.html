                    <p>
                        The existential threat of Covid-19 has highlighted an acute need to develop working
                        therapeutics against emerging health concerns. One of the luxuries deep learning has afforded 
                        us is the ability to modify the landscape as it unfolds — so long as we can keep up with the viral 
                        threat, and access the right data. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with all new medical maladies, oftentimes the data need time to catch up, and the virus 
                        takes no time to slow down, posing a difficult challenge as it can quickly mutate and become 
                        resistant to existing drugs. This led scientists from MIT’s Computer Science and 
                        Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health to ask: 
                        How can we identify the right synergistic drug combinations for the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2?  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typically, data scientists use deep learning to pick out drug combinations with large existing datasets 
                        for things like cancer and cardiovascular disease, but, understandably, they can’t be used for 
                        new illnesses with limited data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without the necessary facts and figures, the team needed a new approach: a neural network that 
                        wears two hats. Since drug synergy often occurs through inhibition of biological targets (like proteins 
                        or nucleic acids), the model jointly learns drug-target interaction and drug-drug synergy to mine 
                        new combinations. The drug-target predictor models the interaction between a drug and a set of known 
                        biological targets that are related to the chosen disease. The target-disease association predictor 
                        learns to understand a drug's antiviral activity, which means determining the virus yield in infected 
                        tissue cultures. Together, they can predict the synergy of two drugs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two new drug combinations were found using this approach: remdesivir (currently approved by the 
                        FDA to treat Covid-19) and reserpine, as well as remdesivir and IQ-1S, which, in biological assays, 
                        proved powerful against the virus. The study has been <span id="published">published</span> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “By modeling interactions between drugs and biological targets, we can significantly decrease the dependence 
                        on combination synergy data,” says Wengong Jin SM '18, a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard 
                        who recently completed his doctoral work in CSAIL, and who is the lead author on a new paper about the research. 
                        “In contrast to previous approaches using drug-target interaction as fixed descriptors, our method learns to predict 
                        drug-target interaction from molecular structures. This is advantageous since a large proportion of compounds have 
                        incomplete drug-target interaction information.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using multiple medications to maximize potency, while also decreasing side effects, is practically ubiquitous 
                        for aforementioned cancer and cardiovascular disease, including a host of others such as tuberculosis, leprosy, 
                        and malaria. Using specialized drug cocktails can, quite importantly, reduce the grave and sometimes public threat 
                        of resistance (think methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> known as “MRSA”), since many drug-resistant 
                        mutations are mutually exclusive. It’s much harder for a virus to develop two mutations at the same time and then 
                        become resistant to two drugs in a combination therapy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Importantly, the model isn’t limited to just one SARS-CoV-2 strain — it could also potentially be used for the 
                        increasingly contagious Delta variant or other variants of concern that may arise. To extend the model's efficacy 
                        against these strains, you’d only need additional drug combination synergy data for the relevant mutation(s). 
                        In addition, the team applied their approach to HIV and pancreatic cancer.

                Since drug synergy often occurs through inhibition of biological targets (like proteins or nucleic acids), 
                a new artificial intelligence model developed at MIT jointly learns drug-target interaction and drug-drug synergy 
                to mine new combinations.
