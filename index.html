                    The global AI market is predicted to snowball over the next few years, reaching a $190.61 billion market value in 2025. By 2030, 
                    AI will lead to an estimated $15.7 trillion, or 26% increase in global GDP.
                    Industry analyst firm Gartner has also predicted that by 2022 companies will have an average of 35 AI projects in place. 
                    
                    Of all the end-use industries, the market for manufacturing is expected to grow the fastest. Increasing data volume 
                    derived from the manufacturing value chain has led to the involvement of AI-enabled data analytics in the manufacturing 
                    sector. In addition, several industry initiatives, such as Industry 4.0, a connected manufacturing initiative 
                    by the Government of Germany, have proliferated the growth of AI-enabled devices in manufacturing.
                    
                    Businesses have also noted that automating tasks, such as invoicing and contract validation, is a crucial use of AI. 
                    
                    Meanwhile, 80% of retail executives expect their companies to adopt AI-powered intelligent automation by 2027. The most 
                    prominent use case for AI in the retail industry is customer engagement (chatbots, predictive behavior analysis, 
                    hyper-personalization).
                    
                    On the downside, a lack of trained and experienced staff is an expected restriction in the AI market’s growth. 
                    
                    At the <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/global/">AI & Big Data Expo</a> in London this week, all the opportunities and challenges 
                    surrounding AI and big data were keenly debated.
                    
                    The event, part of TechEx Global exhibition and conference, showcased some of next-generation technologies and strategies, 
                    and offered an opportunity to explore and discover the practical and successful implementation of AI & Big Data in driving forward 
                    business for a smarter future.
                    
                    Of all the talking points over the two-day event, some of the more prominent discussions focused on the myths and misunderstanding 
                    of AI, as well as ethics, algorithms and how companies are coping with vast quantities of data.

                    <strong>Dispelling the AI myths</strong>

                    Speaking at the event, Myrna Macgregor, head of machine learning – strategy (acting) & lead, responsible for AI+ML at the BBC, 
                    said: “It’s important to think about what the challenges are. There are some barriers, obviously. Firstly, the technical point. 
                    Very technical terminology is often used in conversation regarding AI and coding algorithms.And these are things that are unfamiliar 
                    to some of the stakeholders you’re going to be working with. 
                    
                    “Secondly, there are a lot of theories about how AI is going to take jobs. That a large percentage of jobs will disappear 
                    in the next 10 to 20 years, and that’s really unhelpful. AI, as an assistive technology, is a tool to help people do that 
                    work. 
                    
                    “Also, a lot of people think that AI is an easy thing to do. There is a perception, perhaps, that AI is something you 
                    can grab off the shelf and throw at problems, or you can just sprinkle a little AI on problem.”

                    <strong>Ethics and responsibility</strong>

                    Macgregor said: “Ethics and responsibility are not a category unto themselves. You have to think about what you’re trying 
                    to achieve from a societal level, but also your existing organisational values and mission, and integrating that into the 
                    technology you’re building. It’s not starting from scratch.
                    
                    “I think the main ingredients of responsibility are to avoid negative inference, building something that works, and 
                    maybe most importantly, building something that works for home users. And that kind of corresponds to how we think 
                    about the BBC – the universality aspect, as well. And I think the two things you need ub order to achieve that are 
                    thoughtfulness – taking a pause and thinking about the impact of what you’re building – and also collaboration. 
                    
                    “It’s important to bring in different stakeholder perspectives, so that you’re really reflecting that collaboration 
                    and different perspectives. From a BBC perspective, responsibility looks like upholding the values that we have as 
                    an organisation. So I independence and impartiality are very important to us in an immediate context.”

                    <strong>Robustness of algorithms</strong>
                    
                    Ilya Feige, director of AI, Faculty, commented: “There’s general intelligence and super intelligence. And there’s a 
                    whole topic there that people worry about a lot, rightfully. But right now, what organisations really need to have 
                    answers to is fairness, explainability, privacy and robustness. 
                    
                    “I feel like the first three are kind of well understood, I assume everyone’s talked about, or read about them a lot. 
                    But maybe robustness is the one least discussed openly, and it’s sort of the endeavour to know when you can trust 
                    your algorithm, or when you can have confidence in it. So where is it likely to go wrong? And there are a bunch of 
                    different ways that can take place, like, my data distribution has changed and so the model is no longer relevant. 
                    It used to be good, but now it’s not. 
                    
                    “And there are other examples like parts of data space, where the model is just catastrophically bad, or even attacks. 
                    So there are examples of ways in which you can attack algorithms and provide data that fools algorithms. So robustness 
                    is a big topic that’s discussed less fairness, privacy and explainability.”
